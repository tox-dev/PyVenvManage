# PyVenvManage

## Introduction

<!-- Plugin description -->

**PyVenvManage** is a plugin for managing the Python interpreter of Pycharm Projects.

It is a general issue that Python projects may have several interpreters in different virtual environments for the
various versions of the language. Managing these venvs is easily done with `tox`, but configuring the project in Pycharm
is painful.

With PyVenvManage the selection and setup of the venv is a few clicks without dialog boxes.

## Features

- Popup menu item to set the project interpreter
- Icon provider to indicate virtual environments in the project view
